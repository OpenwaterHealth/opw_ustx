# Openwater USTX Embedded Repository

## Overview

The Openwater USTX Embedded repository is the firmware for the the USTX embedded hardware based on a ST Microelectronics STM32F446 MCU and Texa Instruments TX7332 ultrasound analog front-end (AFE), the USTX is capable of:

- Real-time signal processing: On-board processing for efficient data analysis and filtering.
- Reliable communication: Secure data transmission through various communication protocols.
- Flexible configuration: Adaptable to different underwater applications through software adjustments.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/OpenwaterHealth/opw_ustx.git
